# Forest Protection System (FPS) 

## Overview
The Forest Protection System (FPS) is a comprehensive integrated surveillance system designed to safeguard forests against illegal activities such as poaching, waste disposal, and wildfires. Leveraging advanced technologies, including YOLOv8 as the backbone architecture and PyTorch framework, FPS provides real-time monitoring and detection capabilities to protect wildlife habitats and natural ecosystems.

## Features
- **Intruder Detection**: Utilizes a network of cameras powered by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect and deter intruders in restricted forest areas.
- **Boundary Surveillance**: Strategically positioned boundary cameras detect wildlife movement indicating potential escapes into human-populated areas.
- **Facial Recognition**: Incorporates facial recognition capabilities to identify intruders and maintain a database for repeat offenders.
- **Smart Sound System**: Detects illegal activities such as poaching using audio cues, enhancing forest security measures.
- **Wildfire Detection**: Monitors forest conditions and identifies potential fire outbreaks to mitigate environmental threats.

## Future Enhancements
- **Thermal Imaging Integration**: Incorporate thermal imaging cameras for nighttime surveillance and in dense foliage where visibility is low.
- **Automated Response System**: Develop an automated system to deploy drones or alert nearby patrols upon intruder detection, reducing response times.
- **Animal Deterrent**: Develop an automated system to deploy ulatrasonic sound to funcation as animal deterrents.

## Dependencies
- YOLOv8
- PyTorch
- Other necessary dependencies as per the project requirements
